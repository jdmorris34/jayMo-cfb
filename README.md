# jayMo CFB Predictions

The ad**j**usted **a**nticipated **y**ield **mo**del, or **jayMo**, is a predictive model that calculates the score for each team playing in a college football game using a mix of advanced and basic stats at the time of their contest.

I am sharing the code I used to create the predictive model as well as the live dashboard that tracks and presents game predictions. The Jupyter notebook files consist of calls to the collegefootballdata (cfbd) API and subsequent data transformation, extraction, and cleanin, and ultimately the creation of the predictive model and final predictions dataset. The R file is the live version of the dashboard accessible at https://jdmorris34.shinyapps.io/jayMo-cfb/.

For data privacy purposes, some code will be retracted such as API keys and MySQL database server access information.
